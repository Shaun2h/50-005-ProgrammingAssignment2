# 50-005 Programming Assignment 2
Simple Server-Client code with basic AES/RSA encryption, depending on what you prefer.<br>
control is within PoohClient / ServerPiglet.java. You just need to fill in the IP/file places.<br>
Keep in mind that this was a practice Program and it's messy. But, it will serve to illustrate what you need. Maybe.<br>

sendWith_ServerPublicKeyEncrypted / send_file_with_AES  are the methods inside ClientWithSecurity to be changed.<br>
So add your file name in place of rr.txt to be sent.<br>
